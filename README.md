Usage: Open the bk2 or tasproj file by either using something like 7zip or chaning the extension to .zip. Extract the `Input Log.txt` file and place it in the same folder as the python script. Run the script from command prompt using 'python bk2tofm2.py'.

It uses the checksum for smb1, so if you're using another rom you may have to change it manually in the fm2. This is required to play the movie on Mesen. You can find the checksum for your rom by opening it in FCEUX then saving a blank fm2.
